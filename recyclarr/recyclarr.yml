# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/recyclarr/recyclarr/master/schemas/config-schema.json

# An empty starter config to use with Recyclarr.  Update the values below as
# needed for your instance.  You will be required to update the `api_key` and
# `base_url` for each instance you want to use.
#
# If you'd rather use pre-built configuration instead of building your own from
# scratch, see these pages:
#
# - Config Templates: https://recyclarr.dev/wiki/guide-configs/
# - CLI Command: https://recyclarr.dev/wiki/cli/config/list/templates/
#
# This file WILL NOT WORK as it currently is.  You need to read the
# documentation and build this configuration from scratch.  Note that there's no
# "one size fits all" configuration.  Please refer to the TRaSH Guides to
# understand how to build the appropriate configuration based on your hardware
# setup and capabilities.
#
# For more details on the configuration, see the Configuration Reference on the
# wiki here:
